Or maybe let’s talk a little more about it,
How do I ensure I NEVER miss a rare NFT again?
Humans are lazy creatures, we need food, we need sleep and heck, we also need to take toilet breaks every now and then. Depending on how much and what we’re drinking 
(I prefer Jack Daniels when my collection is doing well and just red bull when my wife is pissed)
But oops, back to the bot, so yeah,
Bid Bot is always overlooking your NFT listing. Any NFT. Any Collection. Any price.
  
Bid Bot got you covered! IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY...
BID &  OUTBID - AND OUT-BID AGAIN (if needed)
To help you get your favorite NFT while you sleep!
What all can the Bid Bot do?
• Hype your listing with regular bids to boost the price • Bid low-key to destroy your competition
• Take the floor prices of your collection to the moon
• Scare the paper-hands
• Make you an NFT Millionaire $$$$
Okay, maybe I went a little too far with the last one but you get it...


Don’t take my word, watch the video to see the magic!

1. Do I still have to pay gas?  - Duh! You don’t have to pay gas on bids, the seller does.
2. My NFT isn’t getting any attention, how does this help? Bid Bot will put multiple bids on your art to HYPE it up so that you can attract tons of other buyers with it and sell it for 2x-3x or even 5x the price.
3. Other people keep out-bidding at the last minute and take away the art I want. That’s exactly what Bid Bot fixes for you! It will out-bid every time someone outbids you so you still get your art (you can set limits on how far you would want it to go).
4. I am new to NFTs and bots, can someone teach me how to use this? Absolutely, you get 1 on 1 support training after purchase, just hit me up discord by opening a ticket
5. Can I share my license with a friend?  Yes, you can. Every license can run on 2 different computers at the same time.
6. Is this safe to use? 100%. Hundreds of users have been using it for multiple big projects that I can’t name right now but don’t worry, you’re in safe hands.
